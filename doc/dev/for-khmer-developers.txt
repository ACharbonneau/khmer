A guide for khmer committers
============================

This document is for people with commit rights to github.com/ged-lab/khmer.

----

If you have commit privileges to the ged-lab/khmer repository, here are a
few useful tips.

First, never merge something unless it's been through a review!  This
rule can be broken under specific conditions when doing a release; see
:doc:`release`.

Second, you can authorize a continuous integration run on someone
else's pull request by putting "ok to test" in the comments.

Third, we ask that all contributors set up standing Pull Requests
while they are working something.  (This is a **requirement** if
you're in the GED lab.)  This lets us track what's going on. On the
flip side, please do not review pull requests until they are indicated
as "ready for review".
