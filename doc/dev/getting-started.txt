Getting started with khmer development
======================================

Start by making your own copy of khmer and setting yourself up for
development; then, build khmer and run the tests; and finally, claim
an issue and start developing!

One-time Preparation
--------------------

#. Get a `GitHub <http://github.com>`__ account.

   (We use GitHub to manage khmer contributions.)

#. Fork `github.com/ged-lab/khmer <http://github.com/ged-lab/khmer>`__.

   Visit that page, and then click on the 'fork' button (upper right).

   (This makes a copy of the khmer source code in your own github account.)

#. Clone your copy of khmer to your local development environment.

   Your clone URL should look something like this::

       https://github.com/empty-titus/khmer.git

   and the UNIX shell command should be::

       git clone https://github.com/empty-titus/khmer.git

   (This makes a local copy of khmer on your development machine.)

#. Add a git reference to the khmer ged-lab repository::

       git remote add ged https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git

   (This makes it easy for you to pull down the latest changes in the
   main repository.)

#. Create a virtual Python environment within which to work with
   `virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__::

       python2.7 -m virtualenv env

   (This gives you a place to install packages necessary for running khmer.)

#. Activate the virtualenv and install a few packages::

       . env/bin/activate
       pip install sphinx nose

   (This installs `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and `nose
   <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__, packages we use for
   building the documentation and running the tests.)

Building khmer and running the tests
------------------------------------

#. Activate the virtualenv::

      . env/bin/activae

   You can run this many times without any ill effects.

   (This puts you in a cozy environment that you control.)

#. Build khmer::

      cd khmer
      make

   If this fails, we apologize -- please `go create a new issue
   <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open>`__,
   paste in the failure message, and we'll try to hep you work through it!

   (This takes the C++ source code and compiles it into something that Python
   can run.)

#. Run the tests::

      make test

   You should see lots of output, with::

      Ran 360 tests in 10.403s

      OK

   at the end.

   (This will run all of the Python tests.)

Congratulations! You're ready to develop!

Claiming an issue and starting to develop
------------------------------------------

#. Find an open issue and claim it.

   Go to `the list of open khmer issues
   <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open>`__
   and find one you like; we suggest starting with `the low-hanging fruit issues <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&labels=low-hanging-fruit&page=1&sort=created&state=open>`__).

   Once you've found an issue you like, add a comment "I am working on
   this issue." You've staked your claim!

   (We're trying to avoid having multiple people working on the same issue.)

#. Update your master branch from the main khmer master branch::

      git checkout master
      git pull ged master

   (This pulls in all of the latest changes from whatever we've been
   doing on ged-lab.)

#. Create a new branch and link it to your github fork::

      git checkout -b fix/issue_number
      git push -u origin fix/issue_number

   where you replace "issue_number" with the number of the issue.

   (This is the set of changes you're going to ask to be merged into khmer.)

#. Make some changes and commit them.

   This will be issue dependent ;).

#. Push your branch to your own github fork::

      git push origin

   (This pushes all of your changes to your own fork.)

#. Set up a Pull Request.
