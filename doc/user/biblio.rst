Papers using khmer
==================

khmer was first published in `Scaling metagenome sequence assembly
with probabilistic de Bruijn graphs, Pell et al., 2012
<http://www.pnas.org/content/109/33/13272.full>`__.

Since then, we have `published several additional papers
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/1ruvipqAmaMkN/collections/48107445/public/>`__.

Please also see `the instructions for citing our papers and software
<https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/blob/master/CITATION>`__.

Biological uses outside of the group
------------------------------------

See `this list of papers <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/1ruvipqAmaMkN/collections/48107393/public/>`__ for publications using khmer to analyze
their sequencing data.

Tools building on khmer concepts
--------------------------------

Several `research papers
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/1ruvipqAmaMkN/collections/48101567/public/>`__
have built off of concepts introduced in or elaborated on khmer.
