How to get help
===============

*First*, be sure that you've:

#. read the documentation (this site)

#. worked through relevant examples in the `khmer-recipes
repository <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer-recipes>`__.
Find *khmer-recipes* `documentation here
<http://khmer-recipes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#>`__.

#. Googled the error output and/or keywords related to your
problem.  This will often bring up results from the mailing list,
where others may have discussed solutions to the same issue.

Mailing List
------------

The primary way to get help is through this discussion list:
http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/khmer

When you ask a question, it's important that you ask in a way
that ensures you get the best answer possible and minimizes
back-and-forth with the people trying to help.

Asking a good question
----------------------

#. Be very specific in your subject line.  This will catch the
eye of someone who may know the solution.  A subject line like
"cant get it to work" or "NEED HELP WITH KHMER!!!!!" will almost
guarantee no one helps you.  Example of a good subject line:
"Error message from normalize-by-median 'Hash writing file access
failure:: Bad address'"

#. Include your OS version, Python version, and khmer version.

#. Precisely describe what you are trying to do.  Reread it
from the perspective of someone else trying to reproduce your task.

#. Copy-and-paste the command that is causing the problem.

#. Include the complete error message; if it is large, include a
link to a file.

GitHub
------
