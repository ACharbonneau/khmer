How to get help
===============

First, be sure that you've:

#. read the documentation (this site)

#. worked through relevant examples in the `khmer-recipes
repository <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer-recipes>`__.
Find *khmer-recipes* `documentation here
<http://khmer-recipes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#>`__.

#. Googled the error output and/or keywords related to your
problem.  This will often bring up results from the mailing list,
where others may have discussed solutions to the same issue.

The primary way to get help is through this discussion list:
http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/khmer

Alternately, you can use GitHub (need some advice here about what this means...)

When you ask a question, it's important that you ask in a way
that ensures you get the best answer possible and minimizes
back-and-forth with the people trying to help.
