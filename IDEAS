get callback from partitioning working again!

extract and subset-ize the first k-mers, rather than the read #s.

also 1 bit/hash table entry, for basic partitioning?  (REDUCE MEM USAGE/FP)

replace memory structures for map, set to be cheaper.

implement hierarchical, threaded merge.

run velvet??

TODO in the future
----

put locks around the I/O functions.
